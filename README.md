  Idea: 
  
  We’re always a fan of 2d adventure games on the old cellphone where we control a character to go through challenges, find monsters, and save the world. This time, we want to re-create that kind of game.
 
 In this game, the main character will go to two maps, and each of them contains many challenges: monsters, deadly saws, and traps,... that the character has to overcome to save the day!

Features:
  
  Fatal obstacles
  
  Moving fatal obstacles
  
  Pitfall
  
  Disappearing structure
  
  Key collection to finish the game
